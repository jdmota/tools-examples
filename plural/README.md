# Plural examples

This directory includes a set of Java examples to be verified with Plural.

Since Plural is a unmaintained plugin for Eclipse, you need to download [its source](https://code.google.com/archive/p/pluralism/source/default/source), as well as, the [source of its dependency](https://code.google.com/archive/p/crystalsaf/source/default/source) (Crystal), and add them to [Eclipse Juno](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/juno) (an old version from 2012).
