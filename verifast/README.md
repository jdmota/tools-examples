# Verifast examples

This directory includes a set of Java examples that can be verified with Verifast.

To test the examples one just needs to [install](https://github.com/verifast/verifast/releases) and open the Verifast IDE, then open the `sources.jarsrc` file, and click the "Verify" button.

Verifast should accept all the code in this directory with the message: `0 errors found (227 statements verified)`.
