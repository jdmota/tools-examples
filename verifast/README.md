# VeriFast examples

This directory includes a set of Java examples that can be verified with VeriFast.

To test the examples one just needs to [install VeriFast](https://github.com/verifast/verifast/releases) in the root directory, run the VeriFast IDE by double-clicking the `run.cmd` file in each subdirectory, and then click the "Verify" button.

VeriFast should accept all the code in the subdirectories with a message like: `0 errors found (160 statements verified)`.
